<h3 style="margin-top:20px;">“I just want to start off this post by saying that choosing Neeta to do my bridal mehndi was the best decision I could make. From the very first time she did my mehndi for my rokka, I instantly felt a deep connection and clicked with her right away. I was incredibly happy - I chose her for all my events: rokka, engagement, and wedding. I was getting lots of compliments on all of the functions, especially the wedding. She's gave her full attention to every detail I wanted in my mehndi and stunned me beyond what I had expected. I recommend her to any of my future friends who are getting married, and to any girl looking for getting their mehndi done. The mehndi stain was very dark , just how I wanted. She put such a unique design in my mehndi, that made it different from any bride she's done - which is one thing I love about her. Each bride she does she has a custom design which will make any bride feel so special, just as I did. She gave me a very adorable after-mehndi care kit which came in great use.”</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top:20px;">“Neeta did an AMAZING job. My henna is still going strong a week later and I keep getting a ton of compliments on it. I really appreciated that she listened to what kind of design I wanted. She also read my personality really well, which showed in some of the areas that we hadn't planned for in advance, but ended up perfectly at the time (like the leaf designs she put on my fingertips)! She also did the henna for my female family members and was super accommodating/flexible despite her busy schedule. My family and friends all LOVED the work she did on their henna as well. Would absolutely recommend Neeta to anyone looking to get their henna done.”</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top:20px;">“Neeta auntie was amazing. I have never met someone as talented as her. She is personable, sweet, kind, helpful, and once again a wonderful mehndi artist. Her details and precision are like none other. I would highly recommend Neeta Auntie. She is open to personalize mehndi and truly takes the time to speak to you in advance and the day of to ensure she is giving you the mehndi you have always dreamed of. Thank you Neeta Auntie for the beautiful personalized mehndi that symbolizes the things my husband and I love.”</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top:20px;">“ Neeta is the best mehndi artist there is. I just had to book with her, I even rearranged my mehndi date/time to have her do my mehndi. She is so professional and sweet. She finished my hands and feet in no time. She packed a special bag full of goodies for the bride. She went above and beyond my expectations and you can tell that she loves what she does. Neeta paid great attention to detail and I loved the outcome. I would recommend Neeta Sharma to any and every bride! She is one of a kind with her talent.”</h3>
